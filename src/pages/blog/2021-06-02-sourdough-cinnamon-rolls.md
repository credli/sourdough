description: "Sourdough cinnamon rolls: the new every-weekend tradition? I
  initially began work on this recipe with the intention that these would be a
  wonderful Christmas morning indulgence, the birth of a new holiday baking
  custom. But after making them several times for testing, I’m convinced they
  should perilously be a weekend indulgence. Why limit ourselves and declare
  these only for special events and holidays? Seriously, let’s make them every
  weekend."

Cinnamon rolls fit so perfectly with the cold weather. They’re like that warm blanket you left on the radiator, that puffy wool sweater you wear around the house, or that cup of hot chocolate that breaks through the cold. Layers of tender dough segregated by ribbons of gooey cinnamon-sugar and topped with a creamy, white sugar glaze—it’s enough to make you completely forget it’s cold outside, or perhaps stop caring about winter altogether.
